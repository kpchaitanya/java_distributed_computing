<h3>
Final Project: Distributed Banking System<br>
<br>
Objective:<br> 
Develop a distributed banking system using either Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) or Java IDL (CORBA) as your transport.<br>
</h3> 
<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
<p1>
Enhancing the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to create a complete banking system.<br>
<br>
The banking system consists of an ATM, a Bank, Accounts and a Security service.<br>
<br>
The ATM will support the following operations:<br>
<br>
	1. Deposit: add some dollar amount to a specified account's balance<br>
<br>
	2. Withdrawal: deduct some dollar amount from a specified account's balance<br>
<br>
	3. Balance inquiry: get current balance of a specified account<br>
<br>
	4. Transfer: deduct some dollar amount from a specified account and deposit that amount into another specified account.<br>
<br>
If there are not enough funds in the specified account to complete the operation an error is generated.<br>
<br>
The ATM will authenticate each client request and authorize the operation using the Security service. The ATM will generate an error if the 
authentication or authorization fail.<br>
<br>
The Bank will manage various Accounts and will provide the ATM access to those Accounts.<br>
<br>
Each Account will provide methods for modifying the Account's balance. If a modification cannot be processed due to insufficient funds the
Account will generate an error.<br>
<br>
<h3>Assumptions.</h3>
<p1>
This project does not require that you provided a completely concurrent solution.<br>
<br>
1. We will only be running a single client.<br>
<br>
2. Our Server will likely only facilitate one client connection at a time.<br>
<br>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p1>
There will be two distinct server processes in the system. The first process will host the remote ATMFactory and ATM instances, as before. 
The second process will host a remote Security service and a remote Bank.<br>
<br>
As before, the client will use the ATMFactory to obtain a remote ATM instance.<br>
<br>
The first action a Client will take will be to register itself with the ATM as an ATMListener. The listener interface will have a method to 
receive a TransactionNotification. Whenever the ATM receives a transaction request, the first thing it will do is notify each of its listeners 
with a TransactionNotification indicating that it is about to process the operation. This will let the Client know that the ATM is coordinating 
with the Security service and the Bank to handle the transaction.<br>
<br>
Now, instead of a simple integer account number, each ATM operation will require a complex AccountInfo object as a parameter. AccountInfo will 
include an account number and a personal identification number (PIN).<br>
<br>
The ATM will authenticate the account information and authorize the operation using the remote Security service. If the authentication or 
authorization fail, the operation will throw a security exception.<br>
<br>
If successfully authenticated and authorized, the ATM will perform the operation on the Account specified in the AccountInfo. But the ATM will 
not longer have local Account instances. Unlike the design of the previous homework, now the Account objects are to reside in a central Bank. 
The ATM will get a remote reference to the Account hosted in the Bank process.<br>
<br>
If the remote Account does not have enough funds to process the operation an insufficient funds exception is generated. Otherwise the Account is 
updated appropriately by the ATM.<br>
<br>
Each ATM will maintain its own cash balance, representing the cash on hand. Whenever the ATM processes a withdrawal it will debit its own cash 
balance by the amount of the withdrawl. Whenever a withdrawal is attempted the ATM must verify the it has enough cash on hand to service the 
request. If insufficient cash is available in the ATM it will generate an exception.<br>
<br>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p1>
The system includes the following remote components:<br>
<br>
1. ATMFactory<br>
<br>
2. ATM<br>
<br>
3. Bank<br>
<br>
4. Account<br>
<br>
5. Security<br>
<br>
6. Client (as an ATMListener)<br>
<br>
The system includes the following structures that are passed by value:<br>
<br>
1. AccountInfo<br>
<br>
2. TransactionNotification<br>
<br>
