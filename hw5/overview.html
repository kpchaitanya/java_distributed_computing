Homework 5: Automated Teller Machine<br>
<br>
Objective:<br> 
-Develop distributed Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI).<br>
-Write JUnit test classes for the principal ATM classes.<br>
-Build.xml that will drive the tool ant to build the application, create its jar file and run the JUnit tests.<br>
</h3> 
<h3>Brief description</h3>
<p1>
Developing the distributed Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI) from the principals from the socket based ATM..<br>
<br> 
<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
The ATM will simulate a real world automated teller machine.<br>
The ATM must support a variety of accounts.<br>
The ATM must support the following operations:<br>
<br>
    1. deposit: add some dollar amount to account balance<br>
<br>
    2. withdrawal: deduct some dollar amount from account balance<br>
<br>
    3. balance inquiry: get current account balance<br>
<br><br>

The ATM will run in its own process and will handle remote requests from a client running in some other process.<br><br>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p1>
Defined is an ATM interface that will be implemented by both the real ATM and a client side proxy for the ATM, called a stub. 
The client will use a stub that will proxy all the operations of the ATM and delegate them an implementation object on the server. 
This time, there is no need to generate the stub classes with the rmi compiler. javac, the Java compiler, is the only compiler that is 
run because the stubs are generated for at runtime.<br>
<br>
The ATM includes several individual Accounts and each of the ATM methods includes a parameter that allows the account number to be specified. 
For simplicity we'll assume the account identifier type is int.<br>
<br>
One of the challanges of distributed computing is connecting a client to the first remote object. Once the first object reference is obtained 
it can be used to gain access to other remote components. In fact it might be a good idea if the entire job of this first object we connect 
to should be providing references to other objects. This design is so common it has been detailed as a common design pattern called factory. 
A factory is a remote object whose main job is to provide references to other remote objects, i.e. it is a navigational starting point to find 
our way around objects on the server side. In this system, you will create an ATM factory that the client will use to get a reference to a 
remote ATM.<br>
<br>
The ATM factory is a server side object with a remote interface just like the ATM. You will create an ATMFactory interface that has a single 
method getATM() that returns a remote reference to the serverside ATM instance.<br>
<br>
Changes are made to the ATM interface to make it RMI–ready, including extending java.rmi.Remote and declaring the methods throws 
RemoteException. Additionally, to register the implementation objects, ATMImpl and ATMFactoryImpl, with the RMI subystem to receive requests, 
will need to "export" them via java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject. In less formal terms this means that the implementation classes must build 
on the services provided by this special class by defining your classes to inherit from it.<br>
<br>
The server process will start up, create an ATMFactoryImpl instance, and then register it with the RMI naming service or registry using 
java.rmi.Naming. The client will then be able to lookup the ATM factory and connect to it. Then the client will use the getATM() method of the 
factory to get a remote reference to an ATM instance.<br>
<br>
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p1>
The following diagram illustrates how a factory can be used in bootstrapping a remote application. In the diagram only two ATM instances are 
shown, but imagine a real banking system with hundreds of ATMs. The factory is aware of the remote locations of each ATM instance and can 
provide any one reference to a client application. Without the factory, all of the ATM instances would need to be registered in the 
RMI registry and the client would need to know a unique name for each ATM instance. In this case a factory is extremely useful.<br>

<br><br>
And the following diagram show how the RMI stubs dispatch method calls to remote implementation objects. 
[Note: the server-side proxy, ATM_Skel, has been deprecated and is no longer part of the model.]<br>

<br><br>
The following diagram shows the entire flow from the clients perspective. First the client looks up the ATMFactory in the RMI registry. 
Once it has the factory it can call getATM() to get a reference an actual ATM. And once it has a reference to an ATM it can call methods on it.<br>
