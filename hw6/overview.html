Homework 6: Automated Teller Machine<br>
<br>
Objective:<br> 
-Develop the back end of a distributed Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system using basic Java networking.<br>
-Add threading and synchronization to your distributed (socket-based) Automated Teller Machine (ATM).<br>
-Write JUnit test classes for the principal ATM classes.<br>
-Build.xml that will drive the tool ant to build the application, create its jar file and run the JUnit tests.<br>
</h3> 
<h3>Brief description</h3>
<p1>
Revisiting the socket-based implementation of the Automated Teller Machine that was developed in Homework 4.<br>
<br>
Homework 4 had a major issue that is transparently solved by RMI. With your implementation of the ATM only one client transaction can run 
against the server at any given time.<br>
<br>
If the world's web and application servers were running under similar restrictions the world's the world would be a very serial place, 
every computer request waiting in line, blocked by those made ahead of them.<br>
<br>
Software gets around this problem by implementing processing concurrency in the form of threading.<br>
<br>In Java, a thread is defined as a sequential flow of control within a program.<br>
<br>Concurrency is achieved when you have multiple threads running at the same time, each thread performing a different task within the 
same program.<br>
<br>
RMI provides concurrency by running each remote method in a different thread.<br>
<br> 
In this way, multiple clients can be executing remote methods at the same time in the same server, each remote method executing essentially in parallel.<br>
<br>
We will be adding a level of concurrency to your ATM implementation from Homework 4.<br>
<br>
<h3>Assumptions.</h3>
<p1>
This assignment does not require that you provided a completely concurrent solution.<br>
1. We will only be running a single client.<br>
2. Our Server will likely only facilitate one client connection at a time.<br>
<br> 
<h3>Functional Requirements</h3>
<p1>
The ATM will simulate a real world automated teller machine.<br>
The ATM must support a variety of accounts.<br>
The ATM must support the following operations:<br>
<br>
    1. deposit: add some dollar amount to account balance<br>
<br>
    2. withdrawal: deduct some dollar amount from account balance<br>
<br>
    3. balance inquiry: get current account balance<br>
<br><br>
<h3>Design/Architecture</h3>
<p1>
The ATM will simulate a real world automated teller machine that supports safe access to accounts from multiple concurrent clients.
<br>
We are required to add concurrency (multi-threading) and synchronization to the (single-threaded) socket-based Automated Teller Machine 
(ATM) you produced for Homework 4.
<br>
The ATM will be hosted in its own JVM, distinct from the client JVM. The client will connect to the server using Java networking and 
communicate with the server using your protocol. The major enhancements to your HW4 code include the following:<br>
<br>
	1. In the server each method which operates on your account (deposit, withdraw, get balance) will be executed in a separate thread.<br>
		The server keeps a pool of Threads for this purpose.<br>
<br>
	2. Because the threads will have concurrent access to the same Account object, we must insure that it is protected from data corruption. 
		To do this you will add synchronization points to the code that modifies your Account to prevent multiple threads from interweaving 
		the execution of modification operations.<br>
<br>
As with homework 4, the ATM need only support one Account object.<br>
<br>
The ATM will run in its own process and will handle remote requests from a client running in some other process.<br><br>
